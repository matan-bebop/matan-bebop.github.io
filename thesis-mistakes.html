<h1> List of mistakes in my thesis </h1>

My thesis <i>Photon counting in the microwave domain and its application to superconducting qubit readout</i> was defended on Dec 18, 2023 and was <a href="https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/bitstream/20.500.11880/37533/1/thesis.pdf">published</a> in the Saarland University Library.
As I've found later, it contains mistakes:

<p>
<b>p. 8</b>:
it should be "first-order in Î» suffices"
instead of
"a first-order perturbation theory suffices"
</p>
